# iPad-strat-tools

This is a basic toolset for collecting stratigraphic data in the field
on an iPad, and rendering a seamless high-resolution section that can
be exported to other software such as Illustrator or Procreate more
suited to precision drawing and preparation of publication-ready files.

A new template optimized for your measurement parameters can be made using the
graph-paper preset in GoodNotes. Be sure to leave a one-large-box margin at the
top and bottom of the section drawing area. If you want to change this margin,
adjusting the script will be required.
